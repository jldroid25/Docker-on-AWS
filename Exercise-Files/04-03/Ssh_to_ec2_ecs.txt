In order to gain access to the underlying resources
we _must_ be using the EC2 type for our ECS clusters
and in general you'd want to use the Linux variant
rather than the Windows based cluster environment.

Once that is established, and so long as you have 
access to the private key that is the pair to the
public key associated with the ec2 cluster on
startup, you can:

a) locate the public ENI for the EC2 instace
b) ssh to ec2-user@eni-address
