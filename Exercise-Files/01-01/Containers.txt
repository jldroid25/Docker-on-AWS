Creating a Docker image (container template) is easy and requires the creation
  of a Dockerfile. Let's look at an example.

This simple example creates a local file in the container and serves it with the Nginx web server.  The file includes a version number that can be changed at build time (or run time) by passing an environment variable "VERSION" to the application.

We can then build the instance:

docker build . -t hostname:latest
docker tag hostname:latest hostname:v1

And then verify it's working:

docker run --rm --name test -e VERSION=v2 -itd -p 8080:80 hostname:latest
curl localhost:8080/version/

Which should echo 'v2'

And finaly clean up
docker stop test
docker rmi hostname:v1 hostname:latest
